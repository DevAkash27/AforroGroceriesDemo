Firstly install Android Studio , XCode and node on your machine if not installed.
Run npm i or npm install command inside the code root folder to download node_modules.

To Run application:
#iOS:- npx react-native run-ios 
#Android:- npx react-native run-android.

If still persists any error feel free to contact.
I have added the screenshots of the application also in a separate folder aforroScreenShots of the application.

Thank you
